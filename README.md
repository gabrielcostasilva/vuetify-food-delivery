# Vuetify Food Delivery Platform
This project is based on an ["AAE IdeaPro" Vuetify tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpJ-b_o8KrA).

## Project Overview

This app simulates a food delivery platform. Notice that this app has no real functionality. It is just a demonstration of Vuetify features.

Although it is just a GUI, it helps understanding often used Vuetify components. In addition, it provides a good example for practicing front-end development with Vue and Vuetify. Checkout other branches to see how we could extend this example.

### Main Screen

It consists of three main areas. On the left-hand side, a sidebar lists menu options. On the right-hand side, another sidebar shows user and order details, and payment information. Finally, the center panel shows filter options, followed by available meals.
